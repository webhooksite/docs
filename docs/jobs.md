# Webhook.site Jobs

Webhook.site is a small startup that's fully remote. We believe in absolute trust in our employees. What's important to us is your work output and communication, not how many hours you spend. You'll be working at a company with a lot of dedicated and passionate customers that use the product to [solve real problems](/custom-actions.html) in their work.

## UI & UX Designer/Frontend Engineer

*Posted 3 March 2025*

We are looking for a fixed-length project employee/agency with experience in designing complex software-as-a-service Web applications. 

Among our 300,000 monthly unique users and 2,500 active customers there's a wide variety of users, from Fortune 500 companies to individuals, that use our platform to solve a wide variety of problems that relate to making Web-based software systems talk to each other.

We want to improve on the overall look of Webhook.site, make it more seamless and quick to use as well as making our subscription features more prominent in our users' minds. We want the design of Webhook.site to signify a stable, enterprise-ready application for building Web-based tools. We want to make it easier and more fluid to build workflows with Custom Actions. 

We want to keep the no-registration, no-bullshit, one-click concept that our users know and love. We want to fix problems with existing elements gradually and avoid launching a big redesign that alienates users. The priorities are: 1) tweak and cleanup frontend UI, 2) improvements to Custom Actions builder, 3) improve landing page.

When we think about user interfaces of technical Web-based tools we like to use, and that we think have a good mix of utility and ease of use, tools like [Sentry](https://youtu.be/4djseRVSan8?t=101) or [Zabbix 7](https://youtu.be/p4MxD66k66A?list=PLCFBm2AvdHoB2ENqpqKCdWY-bfmetjCIt&t=274) come to mind.

We expect the product of this project to be changes and additions to our CSS/HTML/JS code, which is written in Bootstrap 3, SASS and AngularJS. We expect that you know what Webhook.site is, why users like it and that you have have a lot of experience with SaaS platforms.

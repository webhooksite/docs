# Webhook.site as Pipedream alternative

Pipedream is a Web-based automation software that lets customers build workflows in a graphical manner. Often these automations are triggered by underlying webhooks.

With Webhook.site, you can also build workflow using [Custom Actions](/custom-actions.html). The following benefits are available when using Webhook.site compared to Pipedream:

* Flat-rate billing - Pipedream can get costly as each time the workflow runs is charged. Webhook.site only charges a flat-rate subscription fee.
* Pipedream is a US-based company, and, as such, does not have to comply with rigorous EU data protection policies. Webhook.site is based in Europe and is compliant with GDPR and other data protection laws.
* More flexibility - Pipedream can be cumbersome to work with. Webhook.site allows you to customize your workflow in a more advanced manner and see exactly what's going on.
* Integrate with any app - you can integrate with any platform using Webhook.site. We support a wide range of connectivity: HTTP APIs, Databases, SSH, email, push notifications - you name it.
* More advanced workflows - you can also run scripts with e.g. JavaScript or WebhookScript.
* Easier debugging - with Webhook.site, you can go back in time and see the data that was received and the logs for each action that's run.

* When creating a URL, it's possible to select a Group to create it in.

## 30 September 2024

* New Feature: Share Links. We've often had customers asking us about how to share a Webhook.site URL and the data it has received with others. With Share Links, you can now quickly share a view-only, whitelabel access link to a Webhook.site URL. If you're a Webhook.site Enterprise customer with a Custom Domain, the share link will use that domain per default. Share Links can be regenerated as needed to reset access.
   ![](https://simonfredsted.com/share/GI1mjpv1hb.png)
* The ability to disable the setting `Require login to view URLs` has been removed.

We will send out a newsletter about this to the small number of affected accounts that has disabled this setting.

## 29 August 2024

* Webhook.site had partial downtime from approx 01:19 to 05:23 UTC. We've identified the fault to be the MariaDB "max connect errors" configuration option, which per default blocks a server IP after very a low number of errors, causing Webhook.site Web servers to lose contact to the DB servers. We've also identified an information leak in an error message which has also been remediated. We apologize.

## 2 August 2024

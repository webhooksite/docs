In WebhookScript they have their own type and are treated as first-class citizens: they can be stored inside variables and passed around as such. Direct invocation of an anonymous function is supported, provided that the anonymous function's definition is enclosed in parentheses. A function does capture its surrounding variables.</p> <p>Example usage: </p><pre><code>// Traditional definition.\nfunction sub(a, b) {\nreturn a - b;\n}\n// A variable \"sub\" that holds the \"sub()\" function is now defined in current scope.\nsub(1, 2); // Returns -1\n// Storing a function value into a variable.\n// Note: This is equivalent to the previous definition.\nsub_2 = function(a, b) {\nreturn a - b;\n};\n// A variable \"sub_2\" that holds the \"sub_2()\" function is now defined in current scope.\nsub_2(1, 2); // Returns -1\n// Creating a function with alternative, short syntax.\n// Note: This is equivalent all of the previous definitions.\nsub_3 = (a, b) =&gt; {\nreturn a - b;\n};\n// A variable \"sub_3\" that holds the \"sub_3()\" function is now defined in current scope.\nsub_3(1, 2); // Returns -1\n// Creating and using an anonymous function directly.\n// Using an alternative, short syntax.\n((a, b) =&gt; {\nreturn a - b;\n})(1, 2); // Returns -1\n</code></pre><p></p>"},{"location":"webhookscript/reference.html#chained-functions","title":"Chained functions","text":"<p>In addition to classical function invocation, WebhookScript additionaly supports Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS) as a way to call functions \"on values\".
